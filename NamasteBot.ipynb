Come here for an epiphanic union with the almighty, or just sit by the scintillating river Ganga and watch your stress float away with the swishing water and a cool, balming breeze.\\n\\n”\\n\\né&\\n\\né&\\n\\nThis Pdf and its contents are copyright © 2013,ixigo.com, all rights reserved. ixigo logo, the character and all other marks displayed herein are registered and/or common law trademarks of ixigo.com and/or third parties.\\n\\nFam ous For\\n\\nPlces To VsitRelyDusCity\\n\\nThe holy town of Haridwar marks the arrival of the River Ganga into the Northern plains, the first time since its origin at Gaumukh, Gangotri. Visitors hail from all across the country, and globe, for a dip in the holy waters of the river, which is believed to wash away one's sins and help attain salvation. The Ganges flows in rapids here, and people throng the Har ki Pauri to take a holy dip in the fast flowing waters. Har ki Pauri has an interesting legend which says that when Garuda, the holy bird, was carrying the pitcher of Amrita (nectar of the Gods), four drops fell, one of which made a pool in Haridwar, now known as Hari ki Pauri. Don’t go too deep or you run the risk of drowning. Evenings are a magical time here, when thousands of earthen lamps are immersed in the river after the aarti. Along the banks of the Ganges, the Chandi Devi Temple, built by the King of Kashmir, rests atop the Neel Parvat. Another important temple in the vicinity is the Maya Devi\\n\\nTemple, where, it is believed that Sati’s heart\\n\\nand navel fell. A cable car ride will take you to the Mansa Devi Temple. The holy town is one of the most sacred Hindu pilgrimage sites in India. The city is also famous for 12- yearly Kumbh Mela, when devotees throng here in large numbers. For a truly fervent, spiritual experience, attend the magnificent and elaborate evening aarti and prayer offerings at Har ki Pauri. Blessed with nature's bounty, Haridwar is home to beautiful flora and fauna. Rajaji National Park offers organised tours and safaris for a closer look at the wildlife. Padartha Farms, located within the premise of the Patanjali Yogpeeth, is the biggest food park in the country. It comes as a respite for city dwellers, with acres of lush farmland and meditation centres. The charming town has been immortalised in many a fiction tales, especially Ruskin Bond’s most loved stories. Remember Bara Bazaar from A Room On The Roof? A popular market, go shopping in the Bara Bazaar, located on the Railway Road. The local delicacies are strictly vegetarian and drinking is not allowed in the city.\", 'When To\\n\\npage 1\\n\\nVISIT http://www.ixigo.com/weather-in-haridwar-lp-1140406\\n\\nJan\\n\\nCold weather.
